TODO

* rects, bars and tiles

* other geoms: ribbon, smooth, crossbar, errorbar, linerange, polygon, rug, 
    step, text

* other scales: area, shape, alpha, date, date time

* position adjustments turn into data transforms (+ change var mapping)
  * jitter: no equiv
  * stack: stack
  * fill: stack + offset = expand
  * dodge: no equiv?

* testing framework
  * ideally output spec, rendered png and ggplot2 png
  * use git to spot changes

* process statistics
  * map variable names to aesthetics
  * transform according to scales
  * compute statistics
  * set up special scales mapping (e.g. y = ..count..)
  * back-transform according to scales
  * unmap variable names (where possible)

* process facetting
  * embed each layer in group mark(s)

* explore behaviour of missing values in vega

NOTES

* to support ggplot2's categorical scales, need some way to provide range
  functions to a scale

* colour scales need to should be able to take an array of length more
  than two, to support more complex colour scales

* need legends, and better support for automatic layout of axes

* no support for dashed lines?
