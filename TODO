TODO

* position adjustments turn into data transforms (+ change var mapping)
  * jitter: no equiv
  * stack: stack
  * fill: stack + offset = expand
  * dodge: no equiv?

* bars and tiles

* other geoms: crossbar, errorbar, linerange, polygon, rug, 
    step

* other scales: area, shape, alpha, date, date time

* process facetting
  * embed each layer in group mark(s)

* explore behaviour of missing values in vega

NOTES

* to support ggplot2's categorical scales, need some way to provide range
  functions to a scale

* colour scales need to should be able to take an array of length more
  than two, to support more complex colour scales

* need legends, and better support for automatic layout of axes

* no support for dashed lines?
