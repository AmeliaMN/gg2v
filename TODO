TODO

* bars
* area scale
* shape scale
* rects and tiles

* testing framework
  * ideally output spec, svg, rendered png and ggplot2 reference plot (png)
  * will probably node installed
  * use git to spot changes

* process statistics
  * map variable names to aesthetics
  * transform according to scales
  * compute statistics
  * set up special scales mapping (e.g. y = ..count..)
  * back-transform according to scales
  * unmap variable names (where possible)

* process facetting
  * embed each layer in group mark(s)

NOTES

* to support ggplot2's categorical scales, need some way to provide range
  functions to a scale

* colour scales need to should be able to take an array of length more
  than two, to support more complex colour scales

* need legends, and better support for automatic layout of axes
