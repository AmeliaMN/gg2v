TODO

* padding
* categorical x and y axis
* categorical colour scales
* continuous colour scales
* gray background
* area scale
* shape scale
* bars
* rects and tiles
* lines and paths? will need path generators
* think about testing framework

* set aesthetics to specific values

NOTES

* geom_point needs adjustments for the default shape 
  (since colour works like fill in that situation)
